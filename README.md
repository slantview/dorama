== Dorama (ドラマ)

"Dorama" (Japanese "ドラマ") is a Japanese television style.  The goal of this project
was to develop a Ruby based Media Center and based on Ruby's roots in Japan, this seemed
like a perfect name for the project.

The goal of this project is to create a Media Management Portal.  Each of the components
should be independent with a strong core built with usability and minimal design as the
basis.
